# SkinAI - SC1015 - FDAA_Team6_XingYun_MehtaNguyenVerma

## Introduction

This is our Mini-Project for Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (SC1005). Our dataset was sourced from Kaggle, which contains labeled images of various skin conditions. 

## Practical Motivation

Early and accurate diagnosis of skin conditions can be challenging due to the wide variety of conditions and their similar visual manifestations. Using a trained model can enable users to detect these conditions without having to get it checked constantly.

## Problem Definition
Skin Disease Detection - Image classification of skin conditions, aiming to assist in automated detection based on visual symptoms

## Objectives
1. Develop a machine learning model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), KNN, Random Forest Classifiers, and Naive Bayes to classify skin diseases.
2. Achieve high accuracy in disease identification
3. Explore different techniques for data preprocessing, evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy score, etc), and deployment of the trained model. 

## Required Python libraries
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- Keras

## Machine learning models used 
- Convolutional Neural Network
- KNN
- Random Forest Classifier
- Naive Bayes

## Skills learned from this project

1. Handling inconsistent datasets for data cleaning and standardization of image size, format, and color channels. Resizing of images for memory efficiency and faster processing
2. Identifying suitable classes for model training 
3. Development of various machine learning models for image classification tasks
4. Understanding of the concepts of metrics used for model evaluation 
5. Collaborating effectively on GitHub and Google Colab with free GPU access
6. Deploying a trained model using Streamlit 
7. Problem-solving and troubleshooting: Learning how to efficiently debug code, address various issues, and optimize the model's performance.
